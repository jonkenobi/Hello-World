# Hello-World
My first repository

Hi there!ã€€

I'm Jonathan and I'm Taiwanese Canadian studying in a Japanese university. 
I've lived in these three countries up to now.
It's 2018.7.17 now and I'm sitting in a class called Economics of Resources and Food.
One of the last classes in my college life. 
Wish you a great future!
